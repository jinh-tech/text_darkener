Text Darkener

Darkens the text in a picture. The darkening might make the text more visible but does not sharpen the image.

Complexity - O(no. of pixels * 100)

This algorithm is very very very very slow..... so have patience while processing an image bigger that 1000 * 1000 pixels.

Check the image "before_and_after.png".

How to use - 

1. In the third line of 'sc.m', put the name of the image within the double quotes.
2. In the 26th line , put the name of the output image within the double quotes.
3. Run the script in Octave.
